# Challenge 01

## Description

The purpose of this challenge was to use the skills learned in the Prework and Module 1 of Bootcamp to refactor existing code. In this project, I changed the given code to be more accessible for screen readers, primarily by changing the HTML code to semantic elements. Then, I had to ensure that the CSS matched those elements. I also consolidated a lot of the styling code by nesting similar code together. I included comments about my changes for the user the see.
